### Project: COVID-19 diagnosis based on Chest X-ray images
*Goal: learn how to use deep learning models for image classification.*

What are you going to do?  
If you prefer other languages over python, please download X-ray images and build a machine learning model for COVID-19 classification.  
If you plan to use python:
<ol>
<li>Step 1: configure your environment, below is a list of needed packages.

- tensorflow      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; version:2.4.1
- Python           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; version:3.8.0
- matplotlib
- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
<li>Step 2: Read and try to understand the code, and then run it, check the performance. 
<li>Step 3: Try to use some strategies to improve the prediction performance (e.g., adjust batch size, add more layers, data normalization, data augmentation using ImageDataGenerator, etc) 
<li>Step 4: Run your modified code, get the performance metrics.
<li>Step 5 (optional): visualize class activation maps using Grad-CAM algorithm.
